				<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>Please allow me to introduce myself. I am an aspiring Software Engineer, currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev and I'm due to finish in June 2021. Being an analytical thinker, who loves to solve problems not only in an career setting, but everyday life, software development felt like the perfect fit. It also presents me with the opportunity to express my innovative and creative side. I'm an avid learner, always trying to discover and gain knowledge on new topics, or expand my current knowledge on old ones. Computer System Analysis is a field which I have become especially interested in, and it is a very rewarding topic to explore. From exploring the world of Software Engineering, to exploring the outdoors. I absolutely love the outdoors, escaping from the constant hustle and bustle and noise of the city. Be it by going hiking in the Garden Route or canoeing on the Oranje River. With so much interesting and insightful podcast channels, I really enjoy listening to a variety of genre's. From factual and informative, to poetic, from witty to deep and inspirational.</p>
		
					<p>Although I don't have experience working as a Software Engineer yet, I have been exposed to many work environments which require the same level of critical thinking, conscientiousness, hard work, discipline, commitment and perseverance. Realising the importance of good communication and teamwork, but always acknowledging that each individual is different and can bring something unique to the work place or project.</p>
		
					<p>My interest in health care can partly be ascribed to the fact that I've worked in health care related settings most of my life, albeit in different capacities. My biggest passion is the field  of mental health and what drives me in almost every aspect of my life is what positive changes and advancements I can bring to mental health care through my role as Software Engineer. My aim is to balance the use of the extraordinary technological innovations developed thus far (especially with respect to the applications of Artificial intelligence) while never neglecting the importance of the human element.</p>
